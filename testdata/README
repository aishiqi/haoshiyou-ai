# How these test data is generate?

Split the prod-snapshot.csv into files named case_XXX (XXX is [10, 100]),
by script split_test_cases.js

Contact <Renjie> before you are going to run the script again or change the prod-snapshot.csv.
Since the test mapping file in '../input/testdata.csv' is related with generated case_XXX.
